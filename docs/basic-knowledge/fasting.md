Fasting (Sawm) is observed during the Islamic month of Ramadan.<br>

From dawn (fajr) until sunset (maghrib), adult Muslims **abstain from:** <br>
- Food and drink <br>
- Smoking <br>
- Marital relations <br>

Fasting is required for healthy adults, but **exemptions exist for:** <br>
- children <br>
- the elderly<br>
- the sick <br>
- travelers <br>
- pregnant or breastfeeding women <br>
- Others who may be harmed by fasting<br>


The fast is broken each evening with a meal called iftar.<br>
The pre-dawn meal is known as suhoor.<br>
Ramadan is also a time of increased prayer, charity, and reading of the Qur’an.<br>


The purpose goes beyond physical restraint and **fasting aims to:** <br>
- Build self-discipline and patience <br>
- Encourage gratitude for everyday blessings <br>
- Foster empathy for those who experience hunger or hardship <br>
- Promote moral awareness and self-control <br>


At the end of Ramadan, Muslims celebrate Eid al-Fitr, a festival marked by prayer, charity, and communal joy.
