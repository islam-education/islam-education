The Five Pillars of Islam are the core acts of worship that shape a Muslim’s faith and daily life:
1) Shahada (Faith) – Declaring belief in one God (Allah) and that Muhammad is His messenger.
2) Salah (Prayer) – Performing the five daily prayers at set times throughout the day.
3) Sawm (Fasting) – Fasting during the month of Ramadan from dawn to sunset.
4) Zakat (Almsgiving) – Giving a portion of surplus wealth to help those in need.
5) Hajj (Pilgrimage) – Making a pilgrimage to Mecca once in a lifetime if physically and financially able.
   
Together, these pillars provide a foundation for belief, worship, charity, self-discipline, and community in Islam.
