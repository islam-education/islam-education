The Five Pillars of Islam are the core acts of worship that shape a Muslim’s faith and daily life:<br>

**1) Shahada (Faith)** <br>
– Declaring belief in one God (Allah) and that Muhammad is His messenger.<br>
<br>
**2) Salah (Prayer)** <br>
– Performing the five daily prayers at set times throughout the day.<br>
<br>
**3) Sawm (Fasting)** <br>
– Fasting during the month of Ramadan from dawn to sunset.<br>
<br>
**4) Zakat (Almsgiving)** <br>
– Giving a portion of surplus wealth to help those in need.<br>
<br>
**5) Hajj (Pilgrimage)** <br>
– Making a pilgrimage to Mecca once in a lifetime if physically and financially able.<br>
<br>
Together, these pillars provide a foundation for belief, worship, charity, self-discipline, and community in Islam.
