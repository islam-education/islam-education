The Five Pillars of Islam are the core acts of worship that shape a Muslim’s faith and daily life:<br>
1) Shahada (Faith) – Declaring belief in one God (Allah) and that Muhammad is His messenger.<br>
2) Salah (Prayer) – Performing the five daily prayers at set times throughout the day.<br>
3) Sawm (Fasting) – Fasting during the month of Ramadan from dawn to sunset.<br>
4) Zakat (Almsgiving) – Giving a portion of surplus wealth to help those in need.<br>
5) Hajj (Pilgrimage) – Making a pilgrimage to Mecca once in a lifetime if physically and financially able.<br>
   
Together, these pillars provide a foundation for belief, worship, charity, self-discipline, and community in Islam.
