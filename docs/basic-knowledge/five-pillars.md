## 1 Shahada (Declaration of Faith)

The Shahada is the foundation of Islam.

It states:<br>
<b> “I testify that there is no deity worthy of worship except Allah, and I testify that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah.” </b>

Arabic transliteration: <br>
<b>("Ash-hadu an la ilaha illa Allah, Wa ash-hadu anna Muhammadan Rasulu-Allah.")</b>


The Shahada affirms:<br>
- absolute monotheism<br>
- rejection of all forms of idol worship<br>
- acceptance of divine guidance through prophets (like Muhammad, Jesus, Abraham, Moses, Noah, ...)<br>

By sincerely affirming this belief, a person enters Islam and all their previous sins are forgiven.
These Muslims are also called "Reverts" because they returned to the previous state of beeing a Muslim.
(Muslims believe everybody is born as a Muslim)

Faith in Islam begins with knowledge,
conviction, and sincerity.




## 2 Prayer (Salah)

## 3 Fasting (Sawm) 

## 4 Almsgiving (Zakat)

# Zakat (Simple Explanation)

**Zakat** is a required form of charity in Islam. <br>
The word *Zakat* comes from Arabic and carries meanings such as **purification** and **growth**.<br>
Muslims give Zakat as an act of worship and as a way to support people in need.<br>

Zakat is only required when a person’s **extra savings** reach a minimum amount called the **niṣāb** and remain above it for **one lunar year**. <br>

---

## What is the Niṣāb?

The **niṣāb** is the minimum amount of wealth a person must have before Zakat becomes obligatory.<br>
It is traditionally calculated using the value of **gold or silver**.

### Approximate Niṣāb Values (for 2026)

- **Silver niṣāb (approximate):** **$2,500 USD**  
- **Gold niṣāb (approximate):** **$18,000 USD**

Some scholars use the **silver standard**, while others use the **gold standard**. This difference can affect whether Zakat is due.

> These values are approximate and can change depending on market prices.

---

## How Much is Zakat?

For common Zakatable wealth such as **cash, savings, and similar assets**, the Zakat rate is:

**2.5% of Zakatable wealth**

Zakat applies only if:
- The niṣāb is reached  
- The wealth is surplus (not needed for daily living)  
- One full lunar year has passed  

---

## Simple Real-World Example (USD)

**Example:**  
Ahmed has **$12,000** in savings.

### Step 1: Compare Savings to Niṣāb

- Compared to **silver niṣāb ($2,500)**  
  - $12,000 is **above** the threshold → Zakat applies  
- Compared to **gold niṣāb ($18,000)**  
  - $12,000 is **below** the threshold → Zakat does not apply  

**Result:**
- Using the **silver standard** → Zakat **is required**
- Using the **gold standard** → Zakat **is not required**

---

### Step 2: Calculate Zakat (If Due)

Zakat = 2.5% of savings
= $12,000 × 0.025
= $300


**Zakat due:** **$300 USD**  
The remaining **$11,700** stays with Ahmed.

## Visual Overview



NISAB (Approximate)
Silver: $2,500 |------------|
Gold: $18,000 |------------------------------|
Ahmed’s savings: $12,000
|--------------------|
Outcome:
✓ Above silver niṣāb → Zakat applies
✗ Below gold niṣāb → Zakat does not apply


---

## Where Does Zakat Go?

Zakat is given to specific groups defined in Islamic teachings, including:
- The poor and needy
- People in debt
- Travelers in difficulty
- Other eligible recipients

Zakat is considered a **right of the poor**, not a favor.

---

## Key Takeaways

- Zakat is **not paid on all money**, only surplus savings
- Eligibility depends on reaching the **niṣāb**
- The standard rate is **2.5%**
- Zakat supports both **spiritual growth** and **social responsibility**
