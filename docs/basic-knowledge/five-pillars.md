2) Prayer (Salah) <br>
3) Fasting (Sawm) <br>
4) Almsgiving (Zakat) <br>
5) Pilgrimage (Hajj) <br>

The Five Pillars of Islam are the core acts of worship that shape a Muslim’s faith and daily life:
1) Shahada (Faith) – Declaring belief in one God (Allah) and that Muhammad is His messenger.
2) Salah (Prayer) – Performing the five daily prayers at set times throughout the day.
3) Sawm (Fasting) – Fasting during the month of Ramadan from dawn to sunset.
4) Zakat (Almsgiving) – Giving a portion of surplus wealth to help those in need.
5) Hajj (Pilgrimage) – Making a pilgrimage to Mecca once in a lifetime if physically and financially able.
   
Together, these pillars provide a foundation for belief, worship, charity, self-discipline, and community in Islam.


## 1 Shahada (Declaration of Faith)

The Shahada is the foundation of Islam.

It states:<br>
<b> “I testify that there is no deity worthy of worship except Allah, and I testify that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah.” </b>

Arabic transliteration: <br>
<b>("Ash-hadu an la ilaha illa Allah, Wa ash-hadu anna Muhammadan Rasulu-Allah.")</b>


The Shahada affirms:<br>
- absolute monotheism<br>
- rejection of all forms of idol worship<br>
- acceptance of divine guidance through prophets (like Muhammad, Jesus, Abraham, Moses, Noah, ...)<br>

By sincerely affirming this belief, a person enters Islam and all their previous sins are forgiven.
These Muslims are also called "Reverts" because they returned to the previous state of beeing a Muslim.
(Muslims believe everybody is born as a Muslim)

Faith in Islam begins with knowledge,
conviction, and sincerity.




## 2 Prayer (Salah)

## 3 Fasting (Sawm) 

## 4 Almsgiving (Zakat)

**Zakat** is a required form of charity in Islam
The word *Zakat* comes from Arabic and carries meanings such as **purification** and **growth**.
Muslims give Zakat as an act of worship and as a way to support people in need.
Zakat is only required when a person’s **extra savings** reach a minimum amount called the **niṣāb** and remain above it for **one lunar year**. <br>




## 5 Pilgrimage (Hajj)
