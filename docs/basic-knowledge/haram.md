## Definition

**Haram (Arabic: حرام)** refers to anything that is strictly prohibited in Islam. A Muslim is required to avoid haram acts as an act of obedience to Allah. Avoiding haram is part of faith, discipline, and submission.

The opposite of haram is **halal (permissible)**.

In Islamic teachings, actions fall into five main categories:

- **Fard (Obligatory)** – must be done
- **Mustahabb (Recommended)** – rewarded if done
- **Mubah (Permissible)** – neutral
- **Makruh (Disliked)** – better to avoid
- **Haram (Forbidden)** – sinful if done

## Principle: Only Allah Defines Haram

In Islam, only Allah has the authority to declare something haram.

> “Do not falsely declare with your tongues, “This is lawful, and that is unlawful,” (only) fabricating lies against Allah. Indeed, those who fabricate lies against Allah will never succeed.”  
> — Qur'an 16:116

Muslims rely on two primary sources:

- The Qur'an
- The Sunnah (teachings and example of Prophet Muhammad ﷺ)
