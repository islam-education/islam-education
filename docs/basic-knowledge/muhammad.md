# Who Is Muhammad ﷺ?

  Muhammad ibn Abdullah ("son of Abdullah"), was born in Mecca in the 6th century.
  Muslims believe he is the final prophet sent by God. He is not worshipped.
  Rather, he is regarded as a messenger, just like Jesus Christ, who conveyed God's message.

## His Role
Muslims believe Muhammad ﷺ:<br> 
  - received revelation from God <br> 
  - taught monotheism <br> 
  - exemplified moral character <br> 
  - lived a life of humility and integrity <br> 

## His Character
Historical accounts describe him as: <br> 
  - truthful <br> 
  - trustworthy <br> 
  - merciful <br> 
  - patient <br> 
  - just

Muslims strive to follow his example in ethics and conduct,
not to deify him.

## The symbol "ﷺ" 
is a special Unicode ligature used by Muslims
  It represents the Arabic phrase "Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam" 

This phrase is an Islamic honorific that translates to:
  - "May Allah honor him and grant him peace" 
  or
  - "Peace and blessings of Allah be upon him". 

Muslims use it as a sign of respect and veneration whenever the name of the Prophet Muhammad is mentioned, whether in speech or in writing, as commanded in the Quran. <br>

  Common English abbreviations for this phrase include: <br> 
  - "PBUH" (Peace Be Upon Him) <br>
  - "SAW" or "SAWS" (Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam) <br>
