Pilgrimage Pilgrimage (Hajj) is a journey to the city of Mecca in present-day Saudi Arabia. <br>
It is an obligation for Muslims to perform once in a lifetime, provided they are physically and financially able to do so. <br>

Hajj takes place during specific days of the Islamic month of Dhu al-Hijjah. <br>

Millions of Muslims from around the world gather, wearing simple white garments that remove visible differences of wealth, status, and nationality. <br>

During Hajj, pilgrims perform a series of rituals that commemorate the legacy of Prophet Abraham, his family, and their devotion to God. <br>

These rituals emphasize: <br>
**Equality** — all pilgrims dress alike and worship together <br>
**Humility** — status and material distinctions are set aside <br>
**Unity** — Muslims from diverse cultures perform the same acts <br>

Hajj is both a physical journey and a spiritual experience. <br>
For many Muslims, it represents renewal, reflection, and a strengthened sense of connection to God and the global Muslim community.
