# Shahada (Declaration of Faith)

The Shahada is the foundation of Islam.

It states:
“I testify that there is no deity worthy of worship except Allah, and I testify that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah.”

Arabic transliteration: ("Ash-hadu an la ilaha illa Allah, Wa ash-hadu anna Muhammadan Rasulu-Allah.")


## Meaning
The Shahada affirms:
- absolute monotheism
- rejection of all forms of idol worship
- acceptance of divine guidance through prophets (like Muhammad, Jesus, Abraham, Moses, Noah, ...)

By sincerely affirming this belief,
a person enters Islam and all their previous sins are forgiven.
These Muslims are also called "Reverts" because they returned to the previous state of beeing a Muslim.
(Muslims believe everybody is born as a Muslim)

Faith in Islam begins with knowledge,
conviction, and sincerity.
