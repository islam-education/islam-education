Prayer (Salah) is one of the central acts of worship in Islam.<br>

Muslims perform five daily prayers at specific times throughout the day:<br>
-before dawn: **Fajr** <br>
-midday: **Dhur** <br>
-afternoon: **Asr** <br>
-after sunset: **Maghrib** <br>
-at night: **Isha** <br>

These regular prayers structure a Muslim’s day around remembrance of God.<br>

Each prayer includes:<br>
-Physical movements (standing, bowing, prostrating, and sitting)<br>
-Recitation from the Qur’an<br>
-Personal supplications and praises of God<br>

Before praying, Muslims perform a ritual washing called **wudu**, symbolizing physical and spiritual cleanliness.<br>
Prayer is performed facing the Kaaba in Mecca, which represents unity rather than worship of a place.<br>

Salah is not only a ritual obligation but also a moment of pause and reflection.<br>

It helps Muslims:<br>
-Stay mindful of God throughout daily life<br>
-Develop discipline and consistency<br>
-Find calm and focus amid routine activities<br>

Prayer can be performed individually or in congregation<br>
Communal prayer, especially the weekly Friday prayer, strengthens social bonds within the community.
