The Qur’an is the holy book of Islam. <br>
Muslims believe it is the word of God (Allah), revealed to the Prophet Muhammad through the angel Gabriel over a period of about 23 years (610–632 CE).<br>
It is considered the final and complete revelation in a long tradition that includes earlier prophets such as Abraham, Moses, and Jesus.<br>

The Qur’an is written and recited in classical Arabic.<br>
While translations exist to help people understand its meaning, Muslims regard the original Arabic text as the Qur’an itself.<br>
Recitation of the Qur’an is an important act of worship and is performed both in daily prayers and independently.<br>

The Qur’an addresses a wide range of topics, including:<br>
-Belief in one God<br>
-Moral conduct and personal responsibility<br>
-Worship and spiritual life<br>
-Social justice, charity, and compassion<br>
-Guidance for family and community life<br>


Rather than being arranged chronologically, the Qur’an is divided into 114 chapters (surahs) of varying length.<br>
Its verses (ayahs) combine instruction, reflection, stories of earlier peoples, and reminders about ethical living.<br>
For Muslims, the Qur’an serves as a source of guidance, not only for religious practice but also for living a meaningful and responsible life<br>
