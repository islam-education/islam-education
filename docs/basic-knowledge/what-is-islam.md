Islam is a monotheistic faith centered on the belief in one God,
known in Arabic as *Allah*.

The word *Islam* means submission —
the conscious submission to the will of the one and only God, creator of the heavens and earth. <br>
A follower of Islam is called a *Muslim*, which means "one who submits to God alone".

**Core Belief**
Islam teaches that:<br>
- God is one, unique, and without partners<br>
- God is merciful, just, and aware of all things<br>
- Humans are created with purpose and responsibility<br>

**Islam, Culture, and Politics**
Islam is a faith and a way of life.
It is not identical to the cultures of Muslim-majority countries,
nor is it a political ideology. Muslims around the world practice Islam
across many cultures, languages, and societies.

**Purpose of Life**
In Islam, the purpose of life is: <br>
- to know and worship God alone <br>
- to live ethically and responsibly <br>
- to prepare for the life to come <br>

Islam emphasizes accountability, compassion, and justice,
both on a personal and social level.
