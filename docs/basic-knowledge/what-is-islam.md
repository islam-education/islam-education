# What Is Islam?

Islam is a monotheistic faith centered on the belief in one God,
known in Arabic as *Allah*.

The word *Islam* means submission —
the conscious submission to the will of the one and only God, creator of the heavens and earth.
A follower of Islam is called a *Muslim*,
which means "one who submits to God alone".

## Core Belief
Islam teaches that:
- God is one, unique, and without partners
- God is merciful, just, and aware of all things
- Humans are created with purpose and responsibility

## Islam, Culture, and Politics
Islam is a faith and a way of life.
It is not identical to the cultures of Muslim-majority countries,
nor is it a political ideology.

Muslims around the world practice Islam
across many cultures, languages, and societies.

## Purpose of Life
In Islam, the purpose of life is:
- to know and worship God alone
- to live ethically and responsibly
- to prepare for the life to come

Islam emphasizes accountability, compassion, and justice,
both on a personal and social level.
