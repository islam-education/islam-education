**Zakat** is a required form of charity in Islam
The word *Zakat* comes from Arabic and carries meanings such as **purification** and **growth**.
Muslims give Zakat as an act of worship and as a way to support people in need.
Zakat is only required when a person’s **extra savings** reach a minimum amount called the **niṣāb** and remain above it for **one lunar year**. <br>

##What is the Niṣāb?

The **niṣāb** is the minimum amount of wealth a person must have before Zakat becomes obligatory. It is traditionally calculated using the value of **gold or silver**.<br>
The niṣāb is originally defined in **weight**, not money. Islamic sources specify the niṣāb using **gold and silver**.

Classical Islamic measurements:<br>
- 20 gold dinars ≈ 87.48 g of gold  <br>
- 200 silver dirhams ≈ 612.36 g of silver <br> 

In modern practice, these weights are converted into local currency using current market prices.<br> 
These weights are fixed, but their currency value changes over time.<br> 

- If your savings equal or exceed **about 87.5 g of gold**, the gold niṣāb is reached  
- If your savings equal or exceed **about 612 g of silver**, the silver niṣāb is reached  

Different scholars use **gold or silver** as the reference, which is why you may see two different niṣāb values.

##Approximate Values (2026)

- **Silver niṣāb (approximate):** **$2,500 USD**  
- **Gold niṣāb (approximate):** **$18,000 USD**

Some scholars use the **silver standard**, while others use the **gold standard**. <br> 
This difference can affect whether Zakat is due.<br> 
These values are approximate and can change depending on market prices.

##How Much is Zakat?

For common "zakatable" wealth such as **cash, savings, and similar assets**, the Zakat rate is:

**2.5% of Zakatable wealth**

Zakat applies only if:<br>
- The niṣāb is reached  <br>
- The wealth is surplus (not needed for daily living)  <br>
- One full lunar year has passed  <br>

##Real-World Example

**Example:**  
Ahmed has **$12,000** in savings.

**Step 1:** Compare Savings to Niṣāb

- Compared to **silver niṣāb ($2,500)**  
  - $12,000 is **above** the threshold → Zakat applies using the **silver standard** <br>
  
- Compared to **gold niṣāb ($18,000)**  
  - $12,000 is **below** the threshold → Zakat does not apply using the **gold standard**



**Step 2:** Calculate Zakat

Zakat = 2.5% of savings
= $12,000 × 0.025
= $300


**Zakat due:** **$300 USD**  
**$11,700** stays with Ahmed.

##Where Does Zakat Go?

Zakat is given to specific groups defined in Islamic teachings, including:<br>
- The poor and needy<br>
- People in debt<br>
- Travelers in difficulty<br>
- Other eligible recipients<br>

Zakat is considered a **right of the poor**, not a favor.

##Key Takeaways

- Zakat is **not paid on all money**, only surplus savings<br>
- Eligibility depends on reaching the **niṣāb**<br>
- The standard rate is **2.5%**<br>
- Zakat supports both **spiritual growth** and **social responsibility**<br>
